## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A web-based developer toolkit offering a suite of interactive, visual, and text-based utilities — designed to speed up programming, clean up messy code, and offer algorithmic insights through visualizations.
Great for developers, learners, and educators seeking powerful tools in one place.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dev Tools Suite is a central hub for small, fast, and helpful web development utilities.
Built for developers who want lightweight, visual, and practical tools without installing anything.

Hosted as a single web app, this site contains everything from a vector-based drawing studio to code formatters and algorithm visualizer.
Tools are all client-side for privacy and performance.
    
🧰 Tool List

    Pixel Vector Studio	Draw pixel-precise grid vector art, ideal for sprites and UI mockups
    
    Code Formatter	        Instantly strips all comments from source code in most languages
    
    Duplicate Remover	Removes duplicate lines in pasted code or text
    
    Kaleidoscope	        Create symmetrical art with mirroring brushes
    
    Big O Notation	        Graph algorithm performance from O(1) to O(n²) and beyond
    
    Sorting Visualizer	Visual demo of common sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
    
    Search Explorer	        Watch search algorithms traverse arrays and trees
    
    Duplicate Code Editor	Merge or delete repeated functions and code snippets interactively

⚙️ How It Works

    Modular SPA: Each tool is a separate module loaded dynamically

    Zero Dependencies: Pure HTML, CSS, JS (some tools use Canvas or SVG)

    Client-Side Only: All data stays local — ideal for privacy and performance

    Tool Routing: Built-in SPA router handles loading tool pages
